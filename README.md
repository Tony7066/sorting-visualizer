# sorting-visualizer
undurstanding various sorting techniques with live graphical variotion that occurs while sorting .

Introduction: Sorting Visualizer is a program that demonstrates how 
different sorting algorithms work by visually representing the sorting process. 
It helps users understand the inner workings of various sorting algorithms and 
provides a visual representation of how elements are rearranged during the 
sorting process.

Sorting Algorithms: My designed Sorting Visualizer typically support a 
variety of sorting algorithms, including popular ones like bubble sort, selection 
sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort, and heapsort. Each algorithm has 
its own approach to rearranging elements in a specific order.

Visual Representation: The visualizer displays a set of elements 
(represented as bars) that need to be sorted. These elements are usually 
randomly arranged at the beginning. As the sorting algorithm progresses, the 
visualizer shows how the elements are being compared, swapped, or moved to 
their final positions.

Features and content of the Program: The designed program contains 
codes of various sorting algorithms as mentioned above. Allows user to select a 
variable sized array, program automatically populates the array with random 
numbers. Programs prompts user to select the desired sorting algorithm to be 
visualised. SDL window opens up showing the current state of sorted array.
Speed of sorting can be manipulated by altering the delay time of renderer.
Blue, Red bars signifies that they are currently being processed, rest elements
(int the form of bars) are represented by Green colour.

Applications:
Educational Tool: Sorting visualizers are commonly used as educational tools to 
teach students and programmers about sorting algorithms. They provide a 
hands-on, visual learning experience that aids in understanding the concepts 
and inner workings of sorting.
